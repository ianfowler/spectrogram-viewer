    <h2>Motivation for the spectrogram</h2>
      <p>
        Audio, like images, posesses the capability to be 
        illusionary as it has no obligation to make sense to 
        an observer. The properties of acoustic waves allows 
        for what sounds like a singular note to actually
        occupy many different frequencies, often integer 
        multiples of what is called the fundamental frequency of 
        the note. When a colleciton of pitches are compiled 
        together, a savvy producer would want to know what 
        collection of pitches are recorded, some metric related 
        to their loudness, and an indication of when the sounds
        are being played. The spectrogram is a tool to make sense 
        of the audio present in a file and simultaneously 
        conveys information in three dimensions. 
      </p>
      <h2>Axis: Time</h2>
      <p>
        The x-axis of the spectrogram represents time, in 
        seconds, of the audio displayed. Try uploading a song and 
        looking along the x-axis. In most songs, a periodic trend 
        happens along this time axis corresponding to the 
        song's tempo. Click <em>Play</em>, <em>Pause</em>, and 
        <em>Stop</em> in order to listen to the uploaded audio.
      </p>
      <h2>Axis: Frequency</h2>
      <p>
        The y-axis of the spectrogram represents the frequency of 
        the audio, in Hz. Loosely, this corresponds to
        pitch. Try uploading a recording of whistling in successive 
        high and low pitches. The variations should be 
        visible along the frequency axis. Select the dropdown in 
        order set the maximum frequency analyzed in the spectrogram.
      </p>
      <h2>Axis: Amplitude</h2>
      <p>
        The color axis of the spectrogram represents the amplitude 
        or, roughly, loudness of the audio at a particular
        frequency and time. Brigher (more yellow) colors correspond 
        to louder audio, while darker (more purple) colors
        correspond to quieter audio.
